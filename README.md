## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease can help save lives and reduce treatment costs. This project leverages machine learning classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data.

## Features

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights into the dataset.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalization.
- Model training and evaluation using classification algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning for improving model performance.
- Saving and deployment of trained models for real-time predictions.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Loading**: Import and examine heart disease datasets.
2. **Data Visualization**: Understand patterns and trends through visual analytics.
3. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and split into train-test sets.
4. **Model Training**: Train classification models using preprocessed data.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of models with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Deployment**: Save the best model for deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas, numpy for data manipulation.
  - matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization.
  - scikit-learn for machine learning modeling.
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for development.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-ml.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and execute the project:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_ML.ipynb
   ```

4. For deployment, use the saved model files to integrate predictions into an application.

## Results

The project achieves a high accuracy in predicting heart disease using multiple algorithms, with a comparison of their performances outlined in the evaluation section.
